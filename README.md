üëã Hi there! I‚Äôm Liam, an aspiring data analyst with a passion for unravelling insights from complex datasets. My journey involves turning raw data into actionable knowledge, and I‚Äôm excited to share my projects and experiences. This GitHub repository showcases my projects across various tools and technologies. Feel free to explore my projects and reach out if you have any questions or collaboration ideas! 

## About Me üéì 

I am from Sunderland. I attended Southmoor Sixthform where I passed with A D-in photography, A C in maths and level 3 BTEC Pass in engineering in 2021. I have 1 and a half years of work experience working retail as a trade/warehouse operative, which taught me many skills such as working both individually and as part of a team, being efficient at spotting and solving problems as they arise, excelling care and approach when assisting customers and great attention to detail. I Love keeping myself busy in my free time by taking on new hobbies such as collecting and repairing old tech, making videos with my friends, building pc, Wood work/carving and currently I started on programming using an Arduino kit. Following the bootcamp I'm looking to develop my knowledge and understanding of the data sector hopefully as an apprentice data analyst.


üìä Proficient in Python, SQL, and data visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn). 
üß© Skilled in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and statistical modelling. 
üåê Curious about web scraping and API integration. 

## Projects

1. **Customer Segmentation** using K-Means Clustering Employed K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior. Cleaned and preprocessed e-commerce transaction data. Visualized segment characteristics using scatter plots and bar charts.
   
2. **Predictive Modeling** for Loan Approval Developed a logistic regression model to predict loan approval probabilities. Engineered features and handled missing data. Achieved an accuracy of 82% on the test set.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Airbnb Listings in London Explored Airbnb listings data for various London neighborhoods. Created interactive visualizations using Plotly. Uncovered pricing trends and popular neighborhoods. 


### PowerBI
- **Project Name**: [Sales report](https://app.powerbi.com/groups/me/reports/968caaf6-be3e-4d84-9470-0713555c2d08/4a1174f39d0ab2660f5d?experience=power-bi)
  - **Description**:Tasked to make an informative sales report dashboard using multiple visualisations I made with some sales data I was given.
  - **Technologies Used**: Used Adventure Works Data to create A sales Report by using the visualisation tools under the Visualisation pane, I then Dragged the data tables from the Data pane into the different axis under the Visualisation pane until I found something that looked nice and easy to read, And then I added them to one dashboard so the consumer would have multi graphs to look at and digest.

### Tableau
- **Project Name**: [UK Industry change](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/liam.byrne8762/viz/UK_Industry_Change/Dashboard1)
  - **Description**: The Project shows the change within each industry operating in the uk using a Heat map and a bar chart.
  - **Technologies Used**: Used the EMSI_Jobchange_UK Excel Data source and imported it into tableau. I made a calculated feild to get the sum of change using data from 2011 and 2014 and added the feild to columns with industry in rows to make bar chart. For the heatmap I used Longitude and Latitude in Rows and Columns with Sum and city in the marks, I then added the bar chart and heatmap visualisations together in a dashboard to create a report.

### MySQL
- **Project Name**: [Project Title](link-to-project)
  - **Description**: Brief description of what the project does and its key features.
  - **Technologies Used**: List the features and databases used in the project.

### Python and Pandas
- **Project Name**: [Project Title](link-to-project)
  - **Description**: Brief description of what the project does and its key features.
  - **Technologies Used**: List the libraries/packages used in the project.

### Excel Modelling
